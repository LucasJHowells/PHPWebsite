{"id":2,"game":"FIFA 20","score":"1","userReview":"A shocker!! How can anyone give this game more than 3 unless you are on EAs payroll or too young to comprehend how basic and shallow a game this is. It’s all about the “spectacular” and zero realism or depth. Bugs and scripting effectively mean it’s an x button mash to advance the story. Giving this a zero to compensate for those giving it a 10. To those who do this, you’re really doing no one any favours. Best to stay away"}
{"id":3,"game":"FORZA HORIZON 4","score":"4","userReview":"Building upon everything that has continued to mark out the Forza Horizon series as something special and unique its own right - beyond being Forza Motorsport's carefree sibling - Forza Horizon 4 demonstrates once again just how recklessly entertaining driving roughshod across an open environment can be. Revelling in what makes Britain great, Forza Horizon 4 also proves once more that Playground Games is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to delivering a polished, deep, and thrilling open-world racing experience."}

{"id":5,"game":"ROCKET LEAGUE","score":"5","userReview":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I first loaded up this title, but am I certainly glad I did. It's one of the most addictive games I've ever played. Aside from the vast array of customization at your disposal, the core gameplay is a sight to behold. From driving home goals with blunt force to keeping the ball out of your own goal, the level of depth and strategy that this game encompasses cannot go unstated."}
